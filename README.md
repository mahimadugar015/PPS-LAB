1.1.2	You are given a side S and your task is to find the area of the square.

1.1.3	You are given length L and breadth B and your task is to find the area of the rectangle.

1.1.4	Write a python program to print area of a triangle.

1.1.5	Write a python program to find roots of a quadratic equation by taking the coefficients from the user.

1.1.6	Write a python program to find largest of three numbers.

1.1.7	Write a program to read temperature in Celsius and print the temperature in Fahrenheit.

1.1.8	Write a python program to perform union, intersection and difference operations on Set A and Set B.

1.1.9	Write a python program to check if a given year is leap year or not.

1.1.10	Write a python program to calculate the average marks for 5 subjects. The program should prompt the user to input the marks for each subject. After receiving the input, it should compute the average marks and then determine the corresponding grade based on the following grading system:
•	A: 90 – 100
•	B: 80 – 89
•	C: 70 – 79
•	D: 60 – 69
•	F: Below 60

1.1.11	Write a python program that prompts the user to input a date (year, month, and day) and checks if it is a valid date. If the entered date is valid, the program should increment the date by one day and display the incremented date. The program should take into account leap years when determining the number of days in February.

1.1.12	Write a python program to print factorial of a given number.

1.1.13	Write a python program to print the following pattern.

1.1.14	Write a python program that prompts the user to input three digits (0-9) and checks if the entered digits are valid. If the digits are valid, the program generates all possible combinations if these three digits and prints them. Each combination is formed by arranging the digits in different orders. If the input is not valid (digits are not between 0 and 9), the program should display as “Invalid”.

1.1.15	Write a python program to perform multiplication of two matrices.

1.1.16	Write a python program that prints prime numbers less then n which represents the upper limit.

1.1.18	Write a program to find whether the given string is a palindrome or not.

1.1.19	Write a python program that takes a sentence as input, removes punctuations from the sentence, and displays the modified sentence.

1.1.20	Write a python program to find reverse of a string.

1.1.21. Write a program to print the sum of digits of a number.

1.1.22. Take an integer n from the user. Your task is to Write a program to find out the sum of the digits of the given number using the process of recursion.

1.1.23. Write a Python program that functions as a simple phone book manager with a menu-driven interface. The program prompts the user to choose from the following options:
Add Contact
Remove Contact
Display
Quit

1.1.24. Write a python program to define a module to find Fibonacci Numbers and import the module to another program.


1.1.25. Implement a Python program using a class named Complex to perform operations on complex numbers.

1.1.26. Follow the instructions to create a Python program modeling cars with specific types: Car1 and Car2. Begin by defining a base class Car with attributes brand, price, model, and color. Subsequently, create two derived classes, Car1 and Car2, both inheriting from the Car class.
